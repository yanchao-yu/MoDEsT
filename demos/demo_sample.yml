title: MoDEsT Demo
description: MoDEsT has been designed to support academic and industrial evaluations and demonstrations of the conversational agent. Participants at the conference will be able to view the presentation live via a computer interface on various devices. We will provide multiple devices where users can configure the conversation platform and share the example link with colleagues. We will also offer a basic conversation tools guide to help you build up the dialogue exercise or showcase. The demo is speech- and text-based; virtual and in-person participants can view the entry.

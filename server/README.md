# Modular Dialogue Evaluation & Demo Interface  (Backend)
This is the repository of the backend implementation of Modular Chat Interface

## Built with
Node & ExpressJS

## Setting up project

### 1) Replace `.env.example` with `.env` and follow the steps below to get secret values
- `WIT_TOKEN`: Signup with your facebook account at wit.ai, create an app and check your settings under the management tab for the server access token. This is your WIT_TOKEN

- `GOOGLE_APP_CREDENTIALS`: Follow this [link](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#service-account) to learn how to generate the `secrets.json` file. Once generated and downloaded, add it to the root of your project

- `SHEET_ID`: When you create a sheet from https://sheets.google.com/, this is the `id` in your URL `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{id}`

*[Recommendation]: The use of Google Sheets as backend in this project should be replaced with a better database system. I have shared the current sheet to get a view of how the data is structured. Consider the use of [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)*

### 2)  Install packages and dependencies
Run `npm install`

### 3) Start Server
Run `npm run server` and open `http://localhost:3001/v1` in your browser

## API Endpoints
*~ A better database should be used to replace the spreadsheet currently being used ~*
### `GET /v1/demo`   
This is used to fetch the demo data from the spreadsheet. Visit `http://localhost:3001/v1/demo` in your browser to see data

### `POST /v1/demo`
This is used to save demo data to the database. Data is received is sent to the spreadsheet.

### `POST /v1/bug-report`
This is used to save bug reports filed by users to the database. Data is saved in the same spreadsheet, on different tabs.

### `POST /v1/`
This is used to get responses from the bot when the user makes use of the default custom server
